### 🎯 Objective
The primary goal was to develop a predictive model capable of assessing a customer's loan repayment abilities, thereby enhancing financial inclusion. This involved analyzing a substantial dataset to accurately predict loan repayment probabilities.

### 📊 Project Details
- **Dataset**: The project utilized a dataset with over 100,000 data points, providing a robust foundation for modeling customer behaviors.
- **Data Cleaning**: Implemented comprehensive data cleaning techniques to manage missing values, outliers, and incorrect entries, ensuring high data integrity.
- **Modeling**: Developed a CatBoost Model, chosen for its effectiveness with categorical data. Achievements include:
  - **AUC (Area Under the Curve)**: 0.77, demonstrating strong predictive capabilities.
  - **Accuracy**: 92%, highlighting the model's effectiveness in real-world scenarios.

### 🚀 Outcomes and Impact
- **Deployment**: The model is ready for deployment, allowing financial institutions to better assess borrower creditworthiness.
- **Strategic Insights**: The insights from this project are instrumental in reducing financial risks and supporting more inclusive credit practices.
