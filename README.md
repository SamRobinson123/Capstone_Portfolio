# Capstone Portfolio

This portfolio showcases the Data Science Capstone project, focusing on a real-world application of machine learning techniques to solve a significant problem in the finance sector.

## [Home Credit: Project Overview](https://github.com/SamRobinson123/Capstone_Portfolio/blob/main/HomeCreditModel_Final.ipynb)

### Objective
The primary objective of this project was to develop a predictive model that can assess a customer's ability to repay a loan, thereby increasing financial inclusion. This task involved analyzing a large dataset to predict loan repayment probabilities.

### Project Details
- **Dataset**: The analysis was based on a dataset consisting of over 100,000 data points, which provided a comprehensive set of information to model customer behavior.
- **Data Cleaning**: Extensive data cleaning techniques were applied to handle missing values, outliers, and erroneous entries, ensuring the quality and reliability of the analyses.
- **Modeling**: A CatBoost Model was developed due to its efficiency with categorical data. The model achieved an AUC (Area Under the Curve) of 0.77, indicating a strong ability to differentiate between customers who can and cannot repay a loan.
- **Accuracy**: The model reached an accuracy of 92%, showcasing its effectiveness in predicting loan repayment.

### Outcomes and Impact
- The project successfully provides a model that can be deployed to help financial institutions assess the creditworthiness of potential borrowers, contributing to increased access to credit for underrepresented populations.
- The insights derived from this project can assist in making informed decisions, thus reducing the risk of non-repayment and enabling a more inclusive financial environment.
